\section[Formal Analysis Using Alloy]{\hyperlink{toc}{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}}
	\label{sec:formalAnalysisUsingAlloy}
	The following section considers the essential properties and constraints identified for the specification of the problem and provides a formal model in which it is shown how they will be satisfied. The alloy modeling language is used to model the problem and some possible worlds are also provided in order to clarify the most critical aspects.
